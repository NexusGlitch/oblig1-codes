# oblig1-codes

** NOTE: That I will post a READ ME file to give an explanation and description on what I have done and the reason why or what doesn't working during the coding. 
And since this is an international site, I will be writing in English instead of Norwegian.**

A mandatory assignment for class. The objective was to create HTML & CSS website from scratch. I'm not sure if it's good enough after all, I'm still a noob.
The point with this assignment is to use it as a reference and also to learn from it.
I didn't follow the design layout which had been provided, but rather following it, I did a bit different design. Hopefully, it's acceptable.

Left out Javascript: I didn't use Javascript due to the fact that I feel I still need to sit down and do some exercises just to get the hang of it. It's like a big scary monster, 
and I am afraid of not getting to understand the language of this "monster". I was thinking about creating a hamburger menu with Javascript, but, again... I had to practice
more to become comfident enough. 

Issue(s): I had trouble with the form, it didn't become responsive (I think I know what I did wrong, trying to recall it now, I will need to go back and take a look at it again).
